00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.340
Are you ready?

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.580
OK

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.700
Hello and welcome to English with Lucy

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.000
It's been a long time since I last made a video using my whiteboard

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.580
So, today is going to be a really useful lesson

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.220
It's going to be all about the verb 'to get'.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.220
Ooh! Very important news

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.800
I now have an instagram along with my facebook

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.520
and obviously my youtube channel which is right here

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.160
and for my Chinese followers I've created a Weibo account as well

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.840
and you can communicate with me on there

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.660
Now, I warn you I don't speak Chinese

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.720
So I'm finding it quite difficult but

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.400
I don't want you guys to feel like I don't appreciate you because I do

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.440
So what does 'get' mean?

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.820
Don't tell me that it means 'to obtain' because

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.640
Because that is only one of the many many many uses for get

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.440
Today I've got a really really useful video for you

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.220
It is all about the verb to get and the many uses that it has

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.160
So make sure you watch right till the end!

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.140
So, if you look in an English dictionary, you will probably find

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.140
that there are around 50 uses, 50 individual uses, for the verb to get

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.980
Now, I've managed to group some of these uses into 7 categories

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.040
And today we're going to talk about 6 of them

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.380
I'm going to talk to you about how the verb 'to get'

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.000
Can be used to replace

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.140
to arrive

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.680
to receive or to obtain

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.820
to become

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.580
to bring to buy and to find

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.900
And it can also be added to 'to have' or 'to have to'

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.720
I will then discuss some of the many

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.400
phrases and expressions that can be used with to get

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.740
Now I do have phrasal verbs written here

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.520
but I'm not going to talk about those today

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.540
If you don't know what a phrasal verb is

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.260
I do have a video about how phrasal verbs are made

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.760
and how we use them

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.160
Now there are a lot of phrasal verbs that use the verb to get

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.020
But there are too many to talk about today

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.280
So I promise you that I will make another video

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.560
all about phrasal verbs using get

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.960
So the first one: to travel or to arrive

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.320
Very similar

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.360
How did you get to London?

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.220
I got here by train
